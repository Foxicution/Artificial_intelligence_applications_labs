## Practical work no. 1: Solve the missionaries and cannibals problem using the A* algorithm.
For this I chose to generalise the problem by allowing any number of cannibals, missionaries and any size of the boat. I defined a simple heuristic function *h = (M + C)/ B* where M is the number of missionaries, C is the number of cannibals (on the left shore) and B is the boat size. Because the boat size is variable I defined a funtion to give back all the possible actions based on the boat size. This implementation is using a priority queue (priority queues are used often when implementing the A* algorithm) by using a built in Python library heapq. I chose to do a dumbed down tree construction and rely on my heuristic function to determine if the problem is solvable with the provided initial conditions. The solution can be found in the file [Astar_Missionaries_Cannibals.py](1Missionaries_Cannibals_Astar/Astar_Missionaries_Cannibals.py) and the excel workbook for constructing the algorithm can be found in the file [M_C.xlsx](1Missionaries_Cannibals_Astar/M_C.xlsx)
